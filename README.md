## 🌟 About the Project

At some point, we've all been there—staring at a mountain of course material, wishing we had a study group to help us through it. But finding one? That's the tricky part.  

That’s why we built **StudyLink FUD**, a **straightforward web application** designed specifically for students at **Federal University Dutse (FUD)**. Think of it as a **digital common room** where you can effortlessly connect with classmates who are studying the same courses and share similar academic goals.

## 💡 Problem Statement

Students at Federal University Dutse often face challenges when trying to form collaborative study groups:

1. **Lack of Centralized Information**: Students rely on fragmented communication channels like WhatsApp or Facebook groups.
2. **Difficulty in Matching Compatibility**: Finding peers with similar courses, interests, and schedules is time-consuming.
3. **Time and Coordination Constraints**: Coordinating study sessions across busy schedules is challenging.
4. **Communication Barriers**: Traditional methods of communication are prone to delays and miscommunication.

These issues hinder academic performance, create feelings of isolation, and reduce student engagement.
